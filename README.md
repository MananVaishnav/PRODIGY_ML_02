## K-means Clustering
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into a predetermined number of clusters. 
It is widely used in various applications such as image segmentation, customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and more.

The K-means algorithm aims to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), which measures the compactness of the clusters. However, it's worth noting that K-means is sensitive to the initial placement of centroids and can converge to a local optimum rather than a global optimum. To mitigate this issue, it's common to run the algorithm multiple times with different initializations and select the solution with the lowest WCSS.

K-means clustering has several advantages, including its simplicity, efficiency, and scalability to large datasets. However, it also has some limitations, such as the need to specify the number of clusters (K) beforehand, sensitivity to the initial centroid positions, and its tendency to produce clusters of similar sizes
